# Predicting-Product-Prices-FbProphet
## Project Overview
This projects involves predicting future prices of avocados using Facebook Prophet library. Prophet is an open sources tool used for times series forecasting.
## Introduction

In this project, I delved into the world of time series forecasting with the powerful tool, Facebook Prophet, to predict future prices of avocados. The significance of time series forecasting cannot be overstated, especially in domains where unraveling and predicting trends over time is paramount. I explored the theory and intuition behind Facebook Prophet, highlighting its robust capabilities in the realm of predicting avocado prices. I also learned about its ability to handle missing data, outliers, and holidays, coupled with its flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for predicting avocado prices, which are influenced by various temporal factors.


## 2. Methodology:
   - **Import Libraries and data-sets:**
     We kickstart the project by importing essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and, of course, the Prophet library. The dataset, containing historical avocado prices, is loaded for analysis.

   - **Explore Dataset:**
     Understanding the dataset is crucial. We leverage data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to gain insights into the temporal trends, seasonality, and any potential anomalies present in the avocado prices.

   - **Prepare Data for Facebook Prophet:**
     Processed and formatted the dataset to meet the requirements of Facebook Prophet, ensuring it's ready for time series forecasting.

   - **Understand the Theory and Intuition behind Facebook Prophet:**
    Delved into the underlying principles of Facebook Prophet, grasping its capabilities in handling missing data, outliers, and its flexibility in capturing temporal patterns.

   - **Develop Forecasting Model and Make Predictions:**
     Configured Facebook Prophet parameters to match the characteristics of avocado price data, compiling the model, and training it on historical prices.

## 3. Conclusion:
   The README.md provides a comprehensive overview of the project, explaining the theory behind Facebook Prophet, the steps taken to build the forecasting model, and how the model's performance is assessed. This documentation ensures that anyone exploring this project on GitHub can grasp the methodology and outcomes, fostering collaboration and further exploration in the exciting realm of time series forecasting.
